*  You'll know you're on the right page if it says "forked from" in the upper left corner.

* MAKE SURE YOU ARE WORKING ON YOUR OWN FORK BY CHECKING FOR **YOUR NAME** IN THE TOP LEFT CORNER. 

* Click the "clone button" in the top right to reveal the HTTPS key and copy it.  

* In the command line, navigate to the directory where you want your homework to live.  

* Once you are there, type the command `git clone [_paste https key_]`.  This will pull all of the information from your remote(browser) repo to a local version of it on your desktop.

## Submitting a Homework

- First create new branch
    - `git branch homework`
- Checkout to the new branch
    - `git checkout homework`
### When you've finished your homework, all you have to do is get it online.  To do this, follow these steps:
 
- Stage your changed files.
    - `git add -A` 
- Commit your code.
    - `git commit -m "W01D03 Homework"`
- Push to your remote repository.
    - `git push origin master`

    **Tip:**
    > after `git add -A` you can use the command `git status` to make sure your changes have been staged before committing

- In your browser, go to your Github repo for the homework. You should now see all of your completed homework there.  Once you confirmed you're homework is up online, you can:

- Click on a new pull request. 
    
    >**Pull requests** let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a GitHub repository. Once a pull request is sent, interested parties can review the set of changes, discuss potential modifications, and even push follow-up commits if necessary. We will be using pull requests to submit homework.

- Make sure you are comparing the correct repos. The **base** _(first repo)_ should reference the homework assignment. The **head** _(second repo)_ should reference the work you completed.
